## 1. Materials

### 1.1 Reagents

**Objective**:

This includes **metal precursors**, **additive/promoter precursors**, **solvents**, **base/acid regulators**, **complexing agents**, **surface modifiers**, **passivation atmosphere gases**, **synthesis gas environment gases**, and **any other reagents** reported. The goal is to ensure that the content is **precisely extracted**, **relevant**, and **comprehensive** without introducing unnecessary examples, while **omitting any empty categories**.

---

- **Content Requirements**  
- Extract all **reagents** involved in the experiments based on the following categories (only generate a subsection if at least one reagent of that type appears in the article):  
  1. **Metal precursors**: Reagents providing active metal species for the catalyst.  
  2. **Additive/Promoter precursors**: Promoters, surface modifiers, pH adjusters, etc., that affect catalyst structure or reactivity.  
  3. **Solvents**: For dissolving or dispersing other reagents.  
  4. **Base/Acid Regulators**: Controlling pH or precipitating metal ions.  
  5. **Complexing agents**: Form coordination complexes with metal ions.  
  6. **Surface modifiers**: For coating or special treatment (e.g., silica shells).  
  7. **Passivation Atmosphere Gases**: Gases used to passivate the catalyst surface (e.g., N₂, Ar), including mixtures, flow rates, temperatures, durations.  
  8. **Synthesis Gas Environment Gases**: Gases/mixtures used during synthesis or pretreatment (e.g., H₂/CO, syngas), with ratios, flow, pressure, temperature, and purpose.  
  9. **Other Reagents**: Any additional chemicals (e.g., drying agents, titrants, cleaning agents) not covered above.

- **For each reagent**, extract these details when available:  
  - **Name**  
  - **Chemical Formula / Composition**  
  - **Purity**  
  - **Supplier/Brand & Catalog Number**  
  - **Operational Conditions** (for gases: flow rate, pressure, temperature, duration)  
  - **Purpose**  

- **Specific Guidance**  
  - Assign each reagent to the most specific category.  
  - For dual‐function reagents (e.g., promoter + surface modifier), state both roles in the Purpose field.  
  - **Conditional Subsection Generation**: If no reagents of a given category are reported, skip that subsection entirely and renumber subsequent subsections sequentially.

**Formatting Instructions**

1. **Subsection Headers**: Use `####` with the updated number/title (e.g., `#### 1.1.7 Surface Modifiers` or `#### 1.1.5 Surface Modifiers` if previous categories were skipped).  
2. **Bullet Points**: Each reagent as `- **Reagent Name**:`.  
3. **Detail Order**: Chemical Formula/Composition, Purity, Supplier/Brand & Catalog Number, Operational Conditions (for gases), Purpose.  
4. **Detail Formatting**: Commas between items, brackets for optional details, e.g.:  
   ```
   - **Nitrogen**: N₂, 99.999% purity, Air Products, Flow 50 mL/min at 25 °C for 2 h, Used for passivation of reduced catalyst surface.
   ```  
5. **Grouping**: Within a subsection, you may add bolded sub‐labels (e.g., **Promoter Precursors**, **pH Adjusters**).  
6. **No Extra Text**: Only list reagents and their details—no explanatory prose.
